Chapter 3: Converged in Action ‚Äì Industry Playbooks for Oracle 23ai

‚ÄúArchitecture is only theory until it meets the battlefield of business.‚Äù
This chapter is now restructured into six detailed, standalone playbooks ‚Äî each designed as a workshop-ready lab paper tailored to a specific industry. These are not just success stories; they are roadmaps for replicable transformation using Oracle 23ai.

Each lab has been further expanded as a guided technical do-along ‚Äî designed to help implement real-world use cases with converged features step by step, while maintaining architectural integrity.

    customer KEY (cust_id),
    account KEY (acct_id),
    device KEY (device_id))
  EDGE TABLES (
    owns FROM customer TO account,
    accessed_by FROM account TO device);
Run Graph queries like:

SELECT * FROM PGQL_QUERY('financial_pg', 'MATCH (c:customer)-[:owns]->(a:account)-[:accessed_by]->(d:device) RETURN c, a, d');
Step 5: Fraud Detection with AutoML

BEGIN
  DBMS_DATA_MINING.CREATE_MODEL(
    model_name          => 'FRAUD_MODEL',
    mining_function     => DBMS_DATA_MINING.CLASSIFICATION,
    data_table_name     => 'transaction',
    case_id_column_name => 'txn_id',
    target_column_name  => 'fraud_flag',
    settings_table_name => 'fraud_settings');
END;
